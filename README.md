# A Java Project - Starting From The Bottom

This project is going to expand upon creating a Java project, from start, to finish. This project doesn't have a particular goal, we're just going to use the language itself to learn the features in a way that makes sense and is intuitive. 

I've created goals for the project, which I'll list here:

0. Set the project folder up and create the github repository.
1. Create a Hello World Java project.
2. Use each variable type in Java.
3. Use functions.
4. Use classes.
5. Expand upon classes (derived).
6. Use templates.
7. Use complex data structures. (Stack, queue, hash table, priority queue, etc.)


In addition, we have some pivoting goals:
A. Create a Maven project.
B. Create a Gradle Project.
C. Create a Spring API project.
D. Deploy the project from C onto a cloud service.

For now, everything will be in a new commit. (As opposed to a separate branch.)
