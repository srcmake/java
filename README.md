# A Java Project - Starting From The Bottom

This project is going to expand upon creating a Java project, from start, to finish. This project doesn't have a particular goal, we're just going to use the language itself to learn the features in a way that makes sense and is intuitive. 

I've created goals for the project, which I'll list here:

0. Set the project folder up and create the github repository.
1. Create a Hello World Java project.
2. Use each variable type in Java.
3. For Loops, If Statements
4. Use functions.
5. Arrays, ArrayLists, Imports.
6. Use classes.
7. Inheritence, object oriented programming, Abstract Classes.
8. Complex data structures (stack, queue, priority queue, hash map, set).
9. Generic types.


In addition, we have some pivoting goals:
A. Create a Maven project.
B. Create a Gradle Project.
C. Create a Spring API project.
D. Deploy the project from C onto a cloud service.

For now, everything will be in a new commit. (As opposed to a separate branch.)
